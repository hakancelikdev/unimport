Example: from os import walk from os import walk use ( walk ) For this snippet, autoflake doesn\u2019t change anything, while unimport detects and removes the first walk import. Autoflake replaces unused imports in compound statements with pass , while unimport detects and imports inside compound statements, if it detects that you are expecting an ImportError , it doesn\u2019t remove that particular import. try : from x import y except ImportError : ... For this snippet autoflake replaces the import statement with pass. , while unimport leaves it as is. Autoflake is not accurate when it comes to star import expansions, while unimport can detect and expand them accurately. from math import * use ( RANDOM_VAR ) Running autoflake with \u2013expand-star-import flag on the snippet above turns it into from math import RANDOM_VAR while unimport simple removes the math import because it is not used. Autoflake doesn\u2019t work with multiple star imports, while unimport does. from math import _ from os import _ use(walk, cos) Running unimport on the above snippet with \u2013include-star-imports flag produces the correct output. from math import cos from os import walk use ( walk , cos ) while autoflake simply ignores them. Our outputs are more useful, try using our \u2013check, \u2013diff or \u2013permission commands. Performance \u00b6 Unimport < 0.6.8 was much slower than Autoflake == 1.4 (current latest version as of writing this) but Unimport > 0.6.8 is slightly faster. Reasons to choose autoflake \u00b6 It is faster. When tested, autoflake is 1-4x faster on average. (Unimport is slightly faster now) It removes unused variables which unimport doesn\u2019t support, and is not planning to. Has a feature that removes duplicate keys on objects. Reasons to choose unimport \u00b6 It does more static analysis to increse the accuracy of choosing the correct imports to remove. Can handle star imports more accurately.( https://github.com/myint/autoflake/pull/18 describes their approach) Works with multiple star imports. Removes duplicate imports. Has skip_file feature that allows one to skip an entire file. Allows configuration via pyproject.toml and setup.cfg files. Overall \u00b6 Even though unimport and autoflake has features that are similar, they are not designed to do the same thing. When you are including one to your project, it is a good idea to know what your needs are, and decide accordingly. I can already do this with many IDEs, why should I use Unimport? \u00b6 Sort answer \u00b6 Not everyone works with IDEs and not all IDEs work in all environments. Long answer \u00b6 Imagine that you are working with a team, not everyone\u2019s coding environment is the same, not everyone uses PyCharm or VScode. if you want to apply certain standards, pre-commit can be used, it helps a lot, and if you want to make sure that unnecessary imports are removed before committing, you should use unimport with pre-commit, or Let\u2019s say you want to make sure that there are no unnecessary imports in your entire project, unimport will help you.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"FAQ/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"FAQ/#differences-between-autoflake-and-unimport","text":"Autoflake doesn\u2019t always remove the duplicate imports when they are on separate lines.
