## Typing

Unimport can understand that imports are used these cases.

```python
from typing import List, Dict
def test(arg: List[Dict]) -> None:
   pass
```

---

#### String

Unimport supports the following cases

```python
from typing import List, Dict
def test(arg: 'List[Dict]') -> None:
   pass
```

```python
from typing import List, Dict
def test(arg: "List['Dict']") -> None:
   pass
```

---

#### Comments

**This feature is only available for python 3.8.**

Imports in the example below aren't flag as unused by import.

```python
from typing import Any
from typing import Tuple
from typing import Union
def function(a, b):
    # type: (Any, str) -> Union[Tuple[None, None], Tuple[str, str]]
    pass
```

## All

Unimport looks at the items in the `__all__` list, if it matches the imports, marks it
as being used.

```python
import os

__all__ = ["os"] # this import is used and umimport can understand
```

Other supported operations, **append** and **extend**

```python
from os import *

__all__ = []
__all__.append("removedirs")
__all__.extend(["walk"])
```

after refactoring

```python
from os import removedirs, walk

__all__ = []
__all__.append("removedirs")
__all__.extend(["walk"])
```

---

## Scope

Unimport tries to better understand whether the import is unused by performing scope
analysis.

Let me give a few examples.

**input**

```python
import x

def func():
    import x

    def inner():
        import x
        x

```

**output**

```python
def func():

    def inner():
        import x
        x
```

**input**

```python
import x

class Klass:

  def f(self):
      import x

      def ff():
        import x

        x
```

**output**

```python

class Klass:

  def f(self):

      def ff():
        import x

        x
```
