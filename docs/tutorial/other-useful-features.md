## Skip Import

Leave '# unimport: skip' or '# noqa' at the end of the line to skip imports **for
example:**

```python
import x # unimport:skip
```

```python
from x import ( # noqa
  t, y,
  f, r
)
```

**If version of your python is 3.8+** Unimport support multiple skip like below. _It
doesn't matter which line you put the comment on._

```python
from package import (
    module,
    module1,
)  # unimport:skip
```

or

```python
from package import (
    module, # unimport:skip
    module1,
)
```

```python
# unimport: skip_file

import x

```

or

```python
import x

# unimport: skip_file

```
