## [0.2.6.1] - 22/May/2020

[PR: 0.2.6 by @hakancelik96](https://github.com/hakancelik96/unimport/pull/32)

- 💪 `--include-star-import command add` Include star imports during scanning and
  refactor.

- 🌈 color_diff add It shows the difference between source and refactor better.

- 🐞 All builtins names received during the scan have been fixed. Builtins names will no
  longer be offered as suggestions for star import.

- 🐞 If there is no unused import, the refactor error has been fixed.

- 💪 Import skip feature has been added. Leave '#unimport: skip' at the end of the line
  to skip imports with some rare cases. **for example:**

  ```python
  try:
    import django #unimport:skip
  except ImportError:
    print("install django")
  ```

- 💪 Added support for the rare case of **all**. **for example:**

  ```python
  from codeop import compile_command
  __all__ = ["compile_command"]
  ```

  Thanks to this feature, we take the values ​​in the `__all__` list and see if there is
  any matching import statements. If there isn't, this import is unused import.

- [💪 Support exclude & include config with regex by @hakancelik96](https://github.com/hakancelik96/unimport/pull/36)
  After this feature, we can write the file include and exclude pattern setting with
  regex in the console and in the configuration files.
